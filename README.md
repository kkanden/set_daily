## Tracking daily [Set](https://www.setgame.com/set/puzzle) completion time

This is a simple app to track daily Set completion times among a group
of friends. The data – completion times and players – is stored in an
external database.

### Daily results tab

This tab displays the daily results by each player in `mm:ss.sss`
format. “Add/Remove Record” buttons bring up windows in which the user
can add/remove a record for a player on a given date.

### Statistics tab

This tab is a collection of different ways to visualize each player’s
performance. Among others, it displays top 10 times, best time for each
player, cumulative and rolling (7, 30 day) mean of completion times and
mean completion time by day of week.
